GenTwoo >=0.1.0 is a rewrite from scratch of original effort on `GenTwoo
<https://github.com/naota/gentwoo>`_ by `naota <http://elisp.net/>`_


.. NOTE: following paragraph is indentical in
   /Documentation/product_specification.rst

Purpose of the project is to provide the Gentoo Community with a useful,
scalable, secure, user friendly and engaging package usage tracking on
users machines and possibly per users too.

Later this project may serve as a starting for the idea of Gentoo
Crowdsourced QA, which is floating around the IRC lately.
